# 🔧 Email and Payment System Fixes

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Email "From and To" Issue**
**Problem:** Payment emails were being sent to the sender's email instead of the user's signup email.

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Email is now sent FROM: `process.env.EMAIL_USER` (your Gmail)
- ✅ Email is sent TO: `userData.email` (user's signup email from database)
- ✅ User data is retrieved from authenticated session

**Code Location:**
```javascript
// backend/routes/paymentRoutes.js
const user = await User.findById(req.user.id).select('-password');
const userData = {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,        // ← User's signup email
  location: user.location
};
```

### **2. Service-Based Pricing**
**Problem:** All services had the same fixed price.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created `servicePricing.js` with different prices for each service
- ✅ Each service category has specific pricing
- ✅ Amount is now based on the service chosen

**Service Pricing Examples:**
- **AC Installation:** ₹8,000 - ₹25,000
- **Plumbing Emergency:** ₹1,500 - ₹4,000
- **Electrical Wiring:** ₹2,500 - ₹8,000
- **Deep Cleaning:** ₹3,000 - ₹8,000

### **3. User Data from Signup**
**Problem:** User data wasn't being properly retrieved from signup.

**Solution:**
- ✅ User data is retrieved from database using JWT token
- ✅ Name, email, and location come from user's signup information
- ✅ Authentication is required for payment

## 📧 **Email Flow:**

### **Registration Email:**
1. User signs up with email
2. Welcome email sent to user's signup email
3. Email contains user's name and registration details

### **Payment Email:**
1. User makes payment (must be logged in)
2. System gets user data from database
3. Payment confirmation email sent to user's signup email
4. PDF bill attached to email
5. Email contains service details and payment information

## 🔐 **Authentication Flow:**

1. **User Registration:**
   ```javascript
   // User signs up → Welcome email sent
   const emailResult = await sendRegistrationConfirmation(userData);
   ```

2. **User Login:**
   ```javascript
   // User logs in → JWT token stored
   localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
   ```

3. **Payment Process:**
   ```javascript
   // Payment requires authentication
   const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
   if (!token) {
     alert('Please login to complete payment');
     navigate('/login');
   }
   ```

4. **Email Sending:**
   ```javascript
   // Get user from database using token
   const user = await User.findById(req.user.id);
   const userData = { name: user.name, email: user.email, location: user.location };
   const emailResult = await sendPaymentConfirmation(userData, paymentData);
   ```
